# HashDocs Documentation

![https://hashdocs.github.io][badge-target]

This repository contains the documentation for the HashDocs organization, which provides marketing and
resources for the main [HashDocs][hashdocs] project, as well as official add-on modules. The documentation here is
generated via Jekyll and hosted on [GitHub.io][hashdocs-docs].

This repository is _not_ the source for the main HashDocs project documentation, as each project's documentation is
self-contained in those project repositories. This repository contains common documentation across all HashDocs
official projects, as well as [contributing information][project-contributing] for documentation on HashDocs projects.

## Contributing

There are many ways to contribute to this documentation repository. If you have an idea or have discovered a bug
please [open an issue][project-issues] so it can be addressed.

If you are interested in contributing to the project with design or development, please read our
[Contribution Guidelines][project-contributing] before starting.
